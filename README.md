# Fall 2022 Shopify Backend Developer Challenge

The additional feature chosen was "when deleting, allow deletion comments and undeletion".

NOTE: In this repository, I have included the .env file for ease of access to the databse (for evaluation purposes). In production environments, the .env would not be committed to source control. Additionally, repl.it doesn't support .env files. Because of this, the database connection URLs are hardcoded. Again, this would not be done in a production environment.

# Setup

1. `git clone` this repository
2. Make sure `npm` is installed in your machine.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies required for the application.
4. Run `export proto=https` in shell.
5. Run `npm run start` to start the application
6. After running `npm run start`, replit will automatically open a window with the web app open. If the app is being used locally, then open `http://localhost:3000` to view the web app.
