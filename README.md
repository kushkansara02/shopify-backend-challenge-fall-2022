# Fall 2022 Shopify Backend Developer Challenge

The additional feature chosen was "when deleting, allow deletion comments and undeletion".

NOTE: In this repository, I have included the .env file for ease of access to the databse (for evaluation purposes). In production environments, the .env would not be committed to source control. Additionally, repl.it doesn't support .env files. Because of this, the database connection URLs are hardcoded. Again, this would not be done in a production environment.

# Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure `npm` is installed in your machine.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies required for the application.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the application
5. After running `npm run start`, replit should automatically open a new window in the screen with the deployed web application.
